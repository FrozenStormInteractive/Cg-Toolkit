Cg 2.2 demos demonstrating "latest" profile support CgFX

cgfx_latest - Version of cgfx_bumpdemo loading "latest.cgfx" where
  "compile latest" is used in program state assignments.  Notice how
  cgSetStateLatestProfile is used to demonstrate how the "latest" can
  be explicitly overriden.  cgGetStateLatestProfile is also used.

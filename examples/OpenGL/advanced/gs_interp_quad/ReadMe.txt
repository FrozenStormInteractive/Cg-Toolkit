This CgFX 2.0 example demonstrates improved quadrilateral rendering
with barycentric coordinate interpolation of attributes based on mean
value coordinates implemented via a geometry shader in combination with
a fragment shader.

Attribute interpolation is perspective-correct.

Fragments exterior to a bow-tied quadrilateral are discarded properly.
